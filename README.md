# boltzmann-movie-recommender
In this project, I aim to create a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) that can determine whether someone will like or dislike a movie. The original training set and test set contain ratings that users have given to different movies, where each record shows the rating that a certain user has given to a certain movie. This original data format is changed to be appropriate for the RBM. The RBM architecture is also implemented from scratch as a Python class. The project was developed with PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, and Python.

Topics covered in this project are:
- Deep Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Boltzmann Machines
